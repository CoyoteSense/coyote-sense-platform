# High-Level Architecture Design

CoyoteSense is a hybrid event-driven, actor-based platform focused on trading automation. **Trading is the core use case.**

- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) with Redis for low-latency event streaming between trading units.
- Actor-based concurrency managed by Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
- AI agents (MCP) and finance/payment units are supported as optional, additional features for advanced analytics or financial operations.
- YAML-based CoyoteFlow configuration describes modules, units, and their interactions.

## Main Concepts:

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

- Central event broker: **Redis**.
- Units communicate asynchronously via Redis pub/sub channels.
- Designed for **low-latency event streaming**, suitable for high-frequency trading (HFT). Finance/payment is supported as an additional capability.

### Actor-Based Concurrency

- **Each unit is an actor**: encapsulated, isolated, and supervised.
- **Supervisor (orchestrator)** managed by:
  - Docker Compose (small deployments, testing, development)
  - Kubernetes (production-grade, scaling, fault-tolerance, performance tuning)

### AI Agent & MCP Integration

- **AI agents (aiAgent units) and MCP (management/control plane) units** are supported for advanced automation, analytics, and optimization, primarily for trading but also available for finance/payment workflows.

### Finance/Payment Integration

- **Finance/payment units** are optional and enable integration with payment gateways, financial APIs, and transaction processing.
- Designed for extensibility to support new payment providers and financial instruments.

### CoyoteFlow Configuration

- **Declarative YAML-based business configuration language**.
- Describes modules, units (trading, AI, and optional finance/payment), their interactions, configurations, and runtime modes.
- Compiled by `CoyoteCompiler` into Docker Compose or Kubernetes configurations.

## Core Architectural Benefits:

- **Performance**: Redis for low latency pub/sub; Kubernetes or Compose host-network for HFT.
